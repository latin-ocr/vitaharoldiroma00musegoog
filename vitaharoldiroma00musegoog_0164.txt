'she Life of King Harold. 141

ceive srom Him an eternas kingdom or an eternas
punishment. He knows that is he were to pro·
pose to make war against Him, and were to go
against Him with ten thousand, that He would
come to meet him with twenty thousand, whose
unexpested coming and whose extraordinary pre·
paratione sometimes exterminate and destroy him
whom He assails secretly and powersully when
He is least expested, and he who is unprepared
sor Him.

Putting on one fide, then, his vain desire os a
tempores kingdom, and calling off the fatal purpose
of an earthly strife, he proposes to send an embassy
to that King who is still sar off, impelling him
to inquire from Him what are the terms of a
true peace. And searing that His anger will be
increased by his offences, and lest, perchance, his
embassy alone may not be sufficient to propitiate
Him, he resolves to soek out and entreat others,
fitting and suited to the purpose, with all the
prayers he can, to help him and interpose sor him
with the angry King, whose favour and glory
alone he thought worthy os soliciting. Thus the

outward appearance and inward dispofition of ·

Harold are both suddenly changed. The hand
which he was wont to arm, he supports with a
spear shortened into a staff. Instead of a shield, a
wallet hangs stom his neck. ’ His head, which he

was wont to equip with a helmet, and adom with
a diadem, is straded with a head-dress. His sect ⁸

and legs, in the place of sandals and greaves, are

either altogether bare, or encased in stockings.
