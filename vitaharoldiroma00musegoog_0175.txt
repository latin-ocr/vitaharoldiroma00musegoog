. 1⁸32 lle Life of King Harold

  kingdom which he had sworn to preserve for him,

aud thus broke bis oath, rs stated, wonderful to

χ ’ relate, to have lhed⁸ rte berk, and to have lost rto

' · greennffi and rts foliage. A sight well worth

- ’   ,γ , feeing, for atree which was a little time before

remarkable for the number and thickness of its
' leaves, lhrivelled up from the roots, as quickly as

⁸ , ’ did thegourd of Jonah and the olive of that other
⁴ prophet, and all⁸ rts branches became white The
⁸ , lasting nature of the withered trec, an indestruc-

. tible oak, increasea the miracle of the blight falling
upon it, and this wc have frequently, m common

⁸ · with many more, wonder'ed at.

g Who, indeed, would not be amazed that thrsmk
of such vast magnitude, not weakened by small ⁸
branches but everywhere unbroken, from the lowest
¹ · roots to the topmost leaves, thus strippod of every ,

’ covering of bark, had not already yielded to old age

and course of time, or wasted by decay, or beaten

¹ ’ upon by the violence of the winda, and llooded by

many rains, had not grown rotten or, at least, bent!

· But when we saw the ,trec one hundred and forty

¹ years after this event,when it wasstilltobeseen thus
marked, a man of Rouen declared 'that the crime
of so enormous a perjury had been thus signaliaed ’
« 'by Heaven. The ill-fated tree still stands ata
strort distance from the city itfelf, overhanging a
pleasant glade, which is not far from the bridge
over the Seine stret'ching towards the hermita of
Grandmont The man of Rouen⁸ rs said to have ’
presumed, at the unusual omen, that London would
first be subdued.
