142 she Life of King Harold.

But let me relate the rest in a few words: all the
armour of the warrior, the whole adornment os
this mighty man, is either left off altogether, or
else worn for the humiliation and punishment of
the penitent. Not only is the breastplate not
thrown off , from his shoulders, arms, luins, 3ηά srde,
but it is brought closer to his body; sor the inner
garments being taken off and thrown asrde, the
roughness of the metal is next to the bare flelh.
Thus when awake, he walks, not indeed armed so
much as imprisoned in armour. Thus when he
lleeps, a bed1 does not receive him, but he is em·
bedded ina cuirass. The change in the outer
appearance which he assumed was wonderful.
Pleasant indeed was this great alteration in such a
man, both to the angels and all the saints3 but sar

, more pleasrng was the change wrought in the inner

man by God the Judge, who created and formed
in him light instead of darkness, and turned in a
miraculous manner the man’s whole nature.

ln truth, I say, the change was not brought
about by the hand of man, but by the right
hand of the Most High, at Ἴ whose word a cruel
and savage nature sostens into mildness and gentle·
ness, exaltation becomes humility; but who can
tell of all the benefits os so bleffed 3 change?
That l may condense in a few words an endless
matter: by this change, lust of the flelh and the
‚world was transformed into 3 contempt and hatred
· os such things, and yielded to a defire 3ηά love sor
heavenly things.
