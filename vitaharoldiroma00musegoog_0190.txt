The Life ofKing Harold. 167

lcnoweth all things. As far as we have been able, Ι

we have tried by means of what we have related,
and which appeared to ue not irrelevant to the
subject, to remove the stumbling-stones from the
way, and to make the path plain, the actual nen,
as we trust, guiding us.

It remains for us now to go and meet, with
what fpeed we may, our King and patron, who is
returning to us from his long journey, and to <
follow him to the best of our power with the
devoted service of our trusty pen, as he returns
home first to the home of the Angles and then of
the Angels. But he himself, by accusmg and
judging himself, strove so to anticipate the judg-
ment of man and of God that it mattered very
little to him to be judged by those who, according
aa they were disposed towards him by hatred 'or
goodwill, judge according to their human lights,
generally wrongly, and scldom rightly.
