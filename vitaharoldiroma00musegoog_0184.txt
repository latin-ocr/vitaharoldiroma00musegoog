The Life of King Harold. 161
right hand, aa soon as a little os the sursace had

been bored by an iron, was found to possess a sost· .

ness whence it emitted blood; but it lost not its
hardness, whereby it repelled the hardest auger.
⁸ The right hand os the Lord gave this quality to the
right hand os His image, which, as the Psalmist
sang, hath given strength, whence also it is afitting
quality of thisrmaterial right hand, that being made
Ἴ illustrious by so many signs, and glorious by so many

prodigies, it may seem to declare, not so much in
words asin sach, “The right hand os the Lord

hath exalted me; the right hand os the Lord hath

given strength.”
Now, we have related all this rothe end that the

manisold nature os the heavenly power might appear,
· which was shown in this bending os the sacred head
os the holy image, sor, as we have said, in the slver
as well as the 'stony substance, this wonderful act os
heavenly condescenfion and power shone forth to
our eyes, which we can still behold to-day near
the horn osche altar where the occurrence hap-
pened. For the stone did not crack, nor did the
silver plate experience acleft, or contrade awrinkle,
though it was stretched to an unwonted degree
from that part os the neck through such a bending;
nor was it seen to be solded in the least propor-

tion from the region os the neck and jaw. But
there was an alteration, and nota small one, from its
original position, sor whereas the chin os the image,
as we have sonnerly heard, stood straight out, we
see it now hangs down and settled upon the breast,

by reason osche bending which we have described.
