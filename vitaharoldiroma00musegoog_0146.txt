The Lrse ofKing Harold. 12 3

He considers, also, that he is bound, sor these
substantias favours, to that man whose heavenly

piety had unlocked to him the approaches to so
many privileges, and resolves to present him with
a reward worthy of his saith and devotion} For
there were only two clergy there to pray and take
charge of the service and worship of the Cross,
· though they, indeed, seemed content with their
small emolument and humble dwellings.

But this excellent man, eager to exalt the place

and its worship with all classes os its worshippers, ’

proposes to build there a new temple, to increase
the number of attendants, and to augment their
revenues; and in order that its fame and the throng
of its clergy might display the place in the eyes
os mankind, ennobled as it had been by heavenly
gifts, more famous and more glorious, he caused,

bya prudent arrangement, schools to be founded
there, under the diredtion of Master Ailard, the

preserver of his health,as has been justnow narrated. ’

Nor was he llow to bring forth that which he
had conceived in his mind. Foundations os a
large church are rapidly laid; the walls rise3 losty
columns at equal distances unite the walls with
interlacing arcades or vaults3 aroosos leaden plates
keeps out the wind and the inclemencies of the
westher. The number os clergy is increased froma
lhamesul two to the mystic twelve of the company
of the Apostles, and for this excellent reason, that
the same number of men who had told sorth Christ’s
glory to the world from the beginning, might serve
in eternas praise in the temple of His holy Cross.
