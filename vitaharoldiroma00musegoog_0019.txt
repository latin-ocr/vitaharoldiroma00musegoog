In this unique MS, which has been carefully
collatcd for the press, there are few points to
which the attention of the reader may conve-
niently be directed here. The simple e is used in
all cases for the ae or a os standard Latin ortho-
graphy3 h is occasionally added to such words as
Ι abundo, where the aspirate is manifestly an error,
its addition, no doubt, marking the peculiar pro-
nunciation os Latin by our insular scholars at the
nme when this manuscript was prepared. Another
interesting deviation from the clallical form, but
one which ia very representative os the early
mediaeval period, is the use os the forma reicio,
eicio, etc, for rejicio, ejicio, etc, where thes is
eliminated from its proper 'place between two
vowels. Set is used generally for Sed.

The punctuation is peculiar: no rules appear
