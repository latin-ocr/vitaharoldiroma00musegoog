’ , 2 The Lfi’ of King Harold. 107

' 'places and fitting uses, 'the raw material offered
up by a simple-minded congregation as gifts
“ ’ to the Lord. They knew, too, how with the

hand of a master, a‘nd in accordance with the .

circumstances of the occasion, to polilh each sepa-
'rate article as deftly as polhble, to prune off the
’ superfluous, to arrange the things wanting in
order, to adom the things that were lhapeless.
But all that my want of lkill can venture to
undertake‚ is to hew out from the mountain-side,
and place upon rafts, a quarry in some small
degree prepared for a fabric, and to pilot it down
the stream to more convenient srtes, and 1 lhall
feel that l have done this when I have handed
down, in obediente to your injunetions, a feries of
notices which are calculated to benefit the simple
who will take the trouble to study them, gathered
together from ancient books, from current writings,
from true accounts of the faithful, be they who
they may, and gleaned so as to form the principal
points of interest in this work. So may the gentle
, and placid breeze of your prayers waft into the
harbour of a favourable lhore the fragile bark of
my composition, rigged as it is with the banner
of the Cross forits sail, and the prayers of its
faithfulness for its figurehead. Amen.
