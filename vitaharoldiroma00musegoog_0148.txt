most precious priestly vestments, omamented with
gold and geme, live hoods, ornamented with gold
and geme, in one of which were twelve gold
marks; two copes, ornamented with gold and
gems3 five chalices, two gold and the rest suver,
four altare with their relies, os which one altar

wine-hom, valued at one hundred lhillings; ten
phylacteria, one of which was prepared from two .

offered himself as asweet sacrifice to the Lord,
