lae Lffe of King Harold. 185 ’

unaccustomed to the truth, this man is known to
have introduced into his history what it is plain
was the reverse os the truth, however much the
truth of things is relied on to strengthen one'a story. '
But in the other things, which he commented
upon at one time with a pen os gold, at another
with a pen steeped with pitch, concerning the
merits or manners ' os Harold, as his mind in· .
formed him or report suggested, perhaps* he
wandered srom the path of truth somewhat par·
. donably; but he fell more severely when he at· Ἰ ·
tacked the very Anointed of the Lord. For he .
, turned ¹ upon himself in his impetuosrty three . ,
speara', by which it chanced that, not his person ¹
indeed, buthir truthwas attaeked. He said that j ·
Harold met his death by an arrowwound upon'
his head3 he said that the soldier who attached ’ἶ ·
the dead King's, thigh had been driven from the .
army after censure srom the victorious Duke; he¹ f
related that money was offered by his mother to ι Ὓ
the victorious William fora royal funeral, but ’
that he was ‚taken away, without payment os · Α
money,and buried at Waltham. Thus, concern·'¹ ἱ ’ ·
'ing the thigh, the head, and'the man’s, whole, J
body, the tongue¹ of the speaker, who writes many “sss
χ things m secret, runa riot with more licence than„ '
the'armedhand of the‘ soldier who lights openly. Ἰ ⁴
But the Lord has ¹delivered the poor and needy r·
'‘man-whom He has· proved to be more 'mighty ,Ἴ ’ ³ ’
in most 'things‘ than many oratore and lainga-,stom ,., j ι
